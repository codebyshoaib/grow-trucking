  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need state authority to operate in Ohio?",

    {
      "question": "What pays best in Ohio?",

    {
      "question": "Is Ohio good for new owner operators?",
      "answer": "Ohio offers opportunities for new owner operators, especially with strong freight volume and diverse industries. However, competition can be high in major metro areas.

      "question": "What are the best lanes from Ohio?",
      "answer": "Top lanes from Ohio include routes to major distribution hubs in neighboring states, cross-country routes to high-demand markets, and lanes connecting to major ports. The Major City 1 area typically has the highest volume of outbound freight."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find loads in Ohio?",
      "answer": "Load finding in Ohio involves using load boards, building relationships with brokers, working with dispatchers, and understanding peak booking times. Major load boards like DAT, Truckstop.com, and 123Loadboard have strong coverage in Ohio. Many successful operators also work with professional dispatchers who have established broker relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the seasonal trends in Ohio?",
      "answer": "Ohio experiences seasonal variations based on industry activity, weather patterns, and commodity movements. Generally, Q2 and Q3 see stronger rates due to increased freight volume. Q1 can be slower, while Q4 often sees peak activity. Understanding these patterns helps with strategic planning and rate negotiation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits do I need for Ohio?",
      "answer": "Permit requirements in Ohio depend on your operation type. Standard operations require USDOT and MC numbers. Oversized/overweight loads, hazardous materials, and special routes may require additional permits. Some states have specific fuel tax permits or temporary registration requirements. Always verify current requirements before operating."
