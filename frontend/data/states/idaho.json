  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do I need state authority to operate in Idaho?",
      "answer": "Yes, you need proper authority to operate in Idaho. This typically includes USDOT number, MC number, and state-specific permits. Some states require additional registrations. Consult with a compliance expert to ensure you have all necessary authority before operating in Idaho."

      "answer": "Minimum insurance requirements include primary liability coverage (typically $750,000-$1,000,000), cargo insurance, and physical damage coverage.

    },
    {
      "question": "What pays best in Idaho?",
      "answer": "Premium rates in Idaho typically come from specialized freight including refrigerated loads, flatbed freight, and time-sensitive deliveries. The Manufacturing sector often offers competitive rates. Outbound loads from major distribution hubs also command premium rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Idaho good for new owner operators?",
      "answer": "Idaho offers opportunities for new owner operators, especially with strong freight volume and diverse industries. However, competition can be high in major metro areas. New operators should focus on building relationships with reliable brokers, understanding local regulations, and starting with established lanes before expanding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best lanes from Idaho?",
      "answer": "Top lanes from Idaho include routes to major distribution hubs in neighboring states, cross-country routes to high-demand markets, and lanes connecting to major ports. The Major City 1 area typically has the highest volume of outbound freight."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I find loads in Idaho?",
      "answer": "Load finding in Idaho involves using load boards, building relationships with brokers, working with dispatchers, and understanding peak booking times. Major load boards like DAT, Truckstop.com, and 123Loadboard have strong coverage in Idaho. Many successful operators also work with professional dispatchers who have established broker relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the seasonal trends in Idaho?",
      "answer": "Idaho experiences seasonal variations based on industry activity, weather patterns, and commodity movements. Generally, Q2 and Q3 see stronger rates due to increased freight volume. Q1 can be slower, while Q4 often sees peak activity. Understanding these patterns helps with strategic planning and rate negotiation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits do I need for Idaho?",
      "answer": "Permit requirements in Idaho depend on your operation type. Standard operations require USDOT and MC numbers. Oversized/overweight loads, hazardous materials, and special routes may require additional permits. Some states have specific fuel tax permits or temporary registration requirements. Always verify current requirements before operating."
