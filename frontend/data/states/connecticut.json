    {
      "question": "What are the seasonal trends in Connecticut?",
      "answer": "Connecticut experiences seasonal variations based on industry activity, weather patterns, and commodity movements. Generally, Q2 and Q3 see stronger rates due to increased freight volume. Q1 can be slower, while Q4 often sees peak activity. Understanding these patterns helps with strategic planning and rate negotiation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits do I need for Connecticut?",
      "answer": "Permit requirements in Connecticut depend on your operation type. Standard operations require USDOT and MC numbers.
