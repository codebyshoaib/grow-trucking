      "question": "Is Oklahoma good for new owner operators?",

Many successful operators also work with professional dispatchers who have established broker relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the seasonal trends in Oklahoma?",
      "answer": "Oklahoma experiences seasonal variations based on industry activity, weather patterns, and commodity movements. Generally, Q2 and Q3 see stronger rates due to increased freight volume. Q1 can be slower, while Q4 often sees peak activity. Understanding these patterns helps with strategic planning and rate negotiation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What permits do I need for Oklahoma?",
      "answer": "Permit requirements in Oklahoma depend on your operation type. Standard operations require USDOT and MC numbers. Oversized/overweight loads, hazardous materials, and special routes may require additional permits. Some states have specific fuel tax permits or temporary registration requirements. Always verify current requirements before operating."
